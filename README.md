# ImageSplitter  
It's a simple program that splits images vertically into 2 parts.  
The place where the single image is split, is defined by user's ratio input.  
Program creates 2 folders: source and cropped.  
In source folder user has to manually move all images,  
wheras cropped folder is used to store cropped images.  
Program uses multiple threads to complete the task.  
Apart that cv2 and kivy library has been used in this project.  



## Great for splitting scans
