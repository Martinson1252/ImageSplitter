# ImageSplitter  
It's a simple program that splits images vertically into 2 parts.
The place of the split is defined by user's ratio input.
Program creates 2 folders: source and cropped.
In source folder user has to manually move all images
wheras cropped folder is used to store cropped images.
Program uses multiple threads to complete the task.
Apart that cv2 library has been used in this project.
